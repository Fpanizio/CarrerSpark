## About

**CarrerSpark Global** is a comprehensive job platform designed specifically for the technology sector, bridging the gap between tech professionals seeking opportunities (locally and internationally) and companies recruiting global talent.

### Key Features

- **For Candidates**: Track job applications, monitor technical skills vs requirements, and manage career progression
- **For Companies**: Publish tech positions, manage applications, and identify qualified candidates across different markets
